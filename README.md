# 🦦 Hey! Nice to meet you.

Welcome to my GitHub page!  
I'm **Minai**, a Frontend Developer student based in **Uppsala, Sweden** —  
currently looking for a **LIA internship (Front-end)** starting from **Spring 2027**. 🔍💼

Animals have always been a huge passion in my life 🐾  
I once dreamed of working with animals full-time, but due to health reasons,  
that dream transformed into a beloved hobby and interest instead.  
Today, I put that same passion and care into becoming a great Web Developer 💻✨
